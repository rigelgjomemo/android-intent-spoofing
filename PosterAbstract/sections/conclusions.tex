\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}

In this paper, we provide an automated analysis framework to study vulnerabilities in Android applications arising from the lack of validation checks over Intent data. Improving over the state of the art, we provide proofs of vulnerabilities by automatically generating exploits under the form of malicious data to be sent with an Intent message. %This allows our framework to identify potential vulnerabilities (something already partially explored), but more importantly to validate them with actual exploitation, making sure they are not false positives.
We evaluate our approach and find several vulnerabilities and exploits for those vulnerabilities. Our results confirm that a large percentage of commonly-used applications do not implement appropriate security safeguards.
